# SYNX-website

SYNX website is multipurpose and flexible one page HTML5 template, which effectively showcases services, projects and team without overloading visitors with information. It also utilizes a great deal of on-page animations, making the otherwise minimalistic site eye-catching and attention-grabbing.

Navigation buttons help visitors find what they need without having to scroll the entire page. It also includes a contact button in the top navigation, which directs readers to the contact form at the bottom of the page.

To display everything efficiently, the website makes use of expanders to expand and contract blocks of text. A number counter like the one used increases in count if you or any visitor refreshes their browser. A slider was used to display the testimonials of users of the site's services.
